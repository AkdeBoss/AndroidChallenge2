## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
A simple JetpackCompose based app for count-downs. u can easily count from 9 to 0 i.e full 10 seconds, 1 minute i.e 60 seconds or 10 minutes (i.e grand total of 600 seconds). Any time, any where, are you a director of a newage space mission? a kid/adult/non-robot person who enjoys counting? do you need a crude way of counting down? well, look no further, G.A.M <give me a moment> is the app for you. with exciting UI composed in jetpack compose, say no to messy XMLs, say no to "find view byID", say no to "STATE_ISM" (or yes?) Basically here is a mediocore way of implementation of a new brilliant tool...

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
It all started with someOne challanging someone else, and then it went on.
for years and years people were part of this vicious cycle.... then it was my turn.

I realised the declarative UI was already there in Flutter (a thing i recently started), so none the less when the elders calls upon thee, I was there.

Indeed it was a paradigm shift, also exciting, coz its new and you have to constantly doubt the canary (which doesnt sing all that too well...) and forcequit/restart to even run the simplest of tasks (OH! the horror!!!), when i asked the elders for help, there was no help, googling problems wont always provide the solution, there was no one....(using it yet).

Finally after much efforts and wows, I present you.... MY SUBMISSION to the challenge... vola!!!!!!
